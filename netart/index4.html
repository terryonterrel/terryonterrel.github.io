Lessons from my mother: some of us are not meant to be happy. some of us are just meant to survive. It is ok to disappear when you are needed most. Love in absence. Lessons from my dad: Only Good girls are loved. Obey quietly. Love is conditional. The Unit is more important than the individual. Only thing that matters about you is what someone of authority says matters.</p>
