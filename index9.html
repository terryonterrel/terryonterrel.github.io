<h2>Ghostly Touch</h2>

<p style="background-image: url('img_1202.jpg2');">

I could tell you needed a hug.<br>
not from me.<br>
or anyone else living<br>
to my friend mourning I say,<br>
I hope her ghost finds ways to touch you<br>
Through almost forgotten memories(s)<br>
Speaks to you through lyrics from songs<br>
Through pages that you and she had turned together<br>
I pray her ghost visits in places that only she could enter<br>
May her absence embrace you better than I could.-Terry
